# Project Details 

This project aims to utilize a decentralized network for peer-to-peer file sharing, leveraging blockchain to store and validate transactions between peers. The system comprises four main components:

 - **UDHT** (Users Distributed Hash Table) - a hash table structure that holds peer information, enabling peer connections, information sharing, and network-wide peer updates.
  
 - **FDHT** (File Distribuited Hash Table) - A hash table where peers can store files they wish to share with others, designed to efficiently locate files.

 - **BlockChain** (BlockChain Application) - This blockchain system is responsible for storing and recording new transactions, categorized as _Upload Blocks_, _Download Blocks_, or _Hold Stake Blocks_. It operates using a proof-of-stake mechanism for block validation, ensuring efficient and secure transaction processing within the network.
