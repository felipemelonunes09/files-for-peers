# Files For Peers - UDHT
**Project Status: Development**

This is a repository containing two micro services that compound a distributed hashtable project that area a system part of a Files for Peers project, it relevant to say that this only a part of the project, in this documentation we will discuss the objetives and goals of the project and them go through the two microservies that are in this part of the system.

# Project Details 

This project aims to utilize a decentralized network for peer-to-peer file sharing, leveraging blockchain to store and validate transactions between peers. The system comprises four main components:

 - **UDHT** (Users Distributed Hash Table) - a hash table structure that holds peer information, enabling peer connections, information sharing, and network-wide peer updates.
  
 - **FDHT** (File Distribuited Hash Table) - A hash table where peers can store files they wish to share with others, designed to efficiently locate files.

 - **BlockChain** (BlockChain Application) - This blockchain system is responsible for storing and recording new transactions, categorized as _Upload Blocks_, _Download Blocks_, or _Hold Stake Blocks_. It operates using a proof-of-stake mechanism for block validation, ensuring efficient and secure transaction processing within the network.
